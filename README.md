   - Build a few charts and filters
       - What are the total `sales` by `category` and `year`?
       - What are the total `profit` by `category` and `year`?
       - Which `cities` have generated the highest `sales`?

       - Make your dashboard look better using a [color palette generator](https://coolors.co/)
    - Practice by creating another page named `Customer`, and using any chart/table:
       - What is the name of the Customer with the Highest Sales in New York City?
       - What Sub-Category did this Customer buy, and how much Sales and Profit did this Customer generate for the company?
       - Open question: Is the business doing better or worse off from 2014 to 2017?
